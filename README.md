Programmer for over 20 years. Over 2,800 different developers have started/watched my projects here. Stackoverflow lists in me in the top <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/99923/xeoncross">1% of develpers</a>. I'm the author of the fastest internal serverless app template at the largest technology company in the world. An OWASP contributor. I moderate a community of over 10,000 developers and managers. I've given away millions of lines of code publically and inside companies with thousands of engineers.

Chances are high you've worked with my code, docs, or products (or someone who has). I've designed backend systems, shipped features to millions of people and rewriten applications to meet demand. I can scale teams and applications or build them from scratch. I love teaching other programmers things.

These days I'm trying to focus more effort on being a good dad.
